# Island

Project from the JavaRush school - Simulation of life on an island

The project is a simulation of the ecosystem of the island, which consists of an array of locations.
These locations are filled with different types of organisms such as animals and plants.
The program has implemented classes of animals and plants, which have their own characteristics and the ability to reproduce, eat, move and do other things. 
There is also a factory method that is responsible for creating animal objects. 
The project also contains island management logic, life simulation and statistics output.

# The program starts with the Main class
